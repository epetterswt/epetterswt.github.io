My GitHub account is a collection of web pages that I've coded and designed, or at least tried to start.

This is a brand new repository that should contain some cool stuff as this course goes on.

I opened GitHub Desktop, selected this repository, click the "add" drop-down menu, and the option "clone repository" was right there.
